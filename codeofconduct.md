# CogniCrypt Code of Conduct

## 1. Purpose

A primary goal of CogniCrypt is to be inclusive to the largest number of contributors, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, age, and religion (or absence thereof).

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behaviour. With CogniCrypt being an official Eclipse plugin, its community is part of the wider Eclipse community and falls under the jurisdiction of that community's code of conduct. This code of conduct is not meant in opposition to the official [Eclipse Code of Conduct](https://www.eclipse.org/org/documents/Community_Code_of_Conduct.php), but rather as complementary. We opted to design our own code of conduct to highlight the importance of inclusive and appropriate behaviour for our community. 

We invite all those who participate in CogniCrypt to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.

## 2. Open-Source Citizenship

A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open source citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on our community.

Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society.

If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, we want to know.

## 3. Expected Behavior

The following behaviours are expected and requested of all community members:

  * Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community.
  * Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
  * Attempt collaboration before conflict.
  * Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.
  * Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.
 
## 4. Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are considered harassment and are unacceptable within our community:

  * Violence, threats of violence or violent language directed against another person.
  * Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, anti-semitic, or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.
  * Posting or displaying sexually explicit or violent material.
  * Personal insults, particularly those related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, disability, age.
  * Inappropriate photography or recording.
  * Inappropriate physical contact. You should have someone's consent before touching them.
  * Unwelcome sexual attention. This includes, sexualized comments or jokes; inappropriate touching, groping, and unwelcomed sexual advances.
  * Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following (online or in person).
  * Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.


## 5. Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behaviour from any community member, including those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behaviour is expected to comply immediately.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behaviour, the community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning.

## 6. Reporting Guidelines

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify [Stefan Krueger](mailto:stefan.krueger@crossing.tu-darmstadt.de).

Additionally, community organizers are available to help community members engage with local law enforcement or to otherwise help those experiencing unacceptable behaviour feel safe. 

## 7. Addressing Grievances

If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify the administration of [Collaborative Research Center 1119 CROSSING](https://www.crossing.tu-darmstadt.de/crc_1119/contact_crossing/index.en.jsp) with a concise description of your grievance. Your grievance will be handled in accordance with our existing governing policies.

## 8. Scope

We expect all community participants (contributors, paid or otherwise; and other guests) to abide by this Code of Conduct in all community venues as well as in all one-on-one communications.

This code of conduct and its related procedures also apply to unacceptable behaviour occurring outside the scope of community activities.
